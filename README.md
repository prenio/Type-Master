Program to test knowledge over Pokemon type advantages

I created this program because I needed a way to test and hone my knowledge as a Pokemon player (especially on showdown).
Mastery over the types will enable me to not look up a chart online everytime I play.
I also figured this would be a fantastic personal project for myself.

This would not have been done without the help of Manuel Morales and Hans Husurianto


*NOTE*
This repository contains .jpg files of Pokemon types.
I do not own these pictures, they were taken from Bulbapedia.
